# SSH Key Adder Scripts

This repository contains scripts to simplify adding a local machine's SSH public key to a remote server for passwordless authentication.

* `add-ssh-key.sh`: For Linux and macOS.
* `add-ssh-key.bat`: A self-contained Batch/PowerShell hybrid script for Windows.
* `add-ssh-key.ps1`: A pure PowerShell script, ideal for remote execution from GitHub.

## Features

* **‚ú® Cross-Platform:** Scripts provided for both Windows and Unix-like systems (Linux, macOS).
* **üó£Ô∏è User-Friendly:** A clean, interactive interface guides you through the entire process.
* **üîç Key Detection:** Automatically checks if an SSH key pair already exists on your machine.
* **üîë Key Generation:** Offers to create a new key pair if one doesn't exist.
